# Python Challenge
## Part1 PyBank
In this challenge, the task is to create a Python script which analyzes the financial records of a sample company calculating the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset

* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

The final results should look similar to the following:

  ```text
  Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $22564198
  Average Change: $-8311.11
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Aug-16 ($1862002)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Feb-14 ($-1825558)
  ```

In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

## Part 2 PyPoll

In this challenge, the task is to help a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process. Using a set of raw election data, the task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

* The total number of votes cast

* A complete list of candidates who received votes

* The percentage of votes each candidate won

* The total number of votes each candidate won

* The winner of the election based on popular vote.

The final results should look similar to the following:


  ```text
  Election Results
  -------------------------
  Total Votes: 369711
  -------------------------
  Charles Casper Stockham: 23.049% (85213)
  Diana DeGette: 73.812% (272892)
  Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.139% (11606)
  -------------------------
  Winner: Diana DeGette
  -------------------------
  ```

In addition, the final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
